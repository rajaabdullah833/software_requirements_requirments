## OVERALL_DESCRIPTION

        Create the OVERALL DESCRIPTION section of the SRS document for the system, covering project overview, data flow, target audience, and system goals.
Use the following data:
        
        Target Audience: students, teacher, employees
        Data Management: ['Create', 'Read']
        Analytics: no
                                               

The following charts, which are displayed as icons (and can be generated and saved if you'd like to display others), represent different system goals and data flows, on different topics, and on different projects in different areas of the world.
Each chart shows a different system goals for each project, based on what information the project has been given (i.e., the target audience for the project), what is available for an individual project, and what is available to the project managers on the project's plan.

This data illustrates the system goals of the project.
For example, there is data from another project about the same target audience (the university, the faculty, or students on the project's plan, and the target audience they are seeing) that the project manager can have input into the system.
The data also shows a summary and a step by step breakdown of the goal and the progress of individual projects within each project.
In all of these charts, a small sample of each goal is displayed.
Each chart is an easy one to print and read, and the output from each chart (in the chart for example) shows the system goals of different projects for the project.
The data is in many colors, and can be printed on different substrates of paper to fit different scenarios.

## STAKEHOLDERS

        Create the STAKEHOLDERS section of the SRS document with stakeholders, responsibilities, and primary, secondary, and tertiary users based on:
        
        Stakeholders: students, teacher, employees
        Stakeholder Responsibilities: send doc file, and download pdf
             Assigns to a particular user a responsibility (i.e., "add me to the list of tasks", "add support", and add documentation)
                                 Provide that users should be able to view and access files, make comments, and write documentation that is open to all.svg files
                            Assigns administrators to all tasks and to make sure that their roles are consistent: if there are administrators who do not have a job, they are allowed to have multiple jobs
                           * * *  
In addition, administrators are required to include comments in every file that makes use of the script
                        * * It should be in the following order:
SRC.svg_contents - This defines the filespace of the SRS.
file (if it exists, a.svg directory should also be created.
To create multiple.svg directories one must include a user subdirectory and create one for every line and

## RBAC

        Define the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) structure for the system in the RBAC section of the SRS, based on:
        
        RBAC: no
        RBAC Details: 
                     | The name of the SRS, if any, which identifies the device with which the SRS is to be operated that may have the associated RAR device installed.
If no RBAC field is specified, the application will not be able to register its SRS.

The device name of the RBAC may be specified by the RAR to which an AR-system must be attached that is described in IR 5.1.14.
As with other RAR devices, if the user specifies a name that the RAR must be attached, and RAR must receive a device identifier of the SAR identifier specified in IR 5.1.14, that name is to be registered in the system when a user or user agents are attached to the system.

RAR is described in IR 5.1.1 for the IR devices described in Appendix C to Table 5.

r-r: System information and capabilities

r: RARS

RAR information and capabilities for the IR devices described in Appendix C to Table 5.
r-RAS: System parameters and parameters

RAR information and capabilities for the system parameters described in Appendix C to Table 5.
r-RAM: System parameters related to the AR control

RAR information and capabilities for the AR control for the system details.
r-RPi: RAR details

r-RPi Details: The user agent

## SYSTEM_FEATURES

        Create the SYSTEM FEATURES section for the SRS document for the AI-Integrated Business Management and Analytics System, based on:
        
        System Features and Use Cases: pdf generator that will convert the doc file to pdf file and it will be will structured.
        Performance Requirements: take less time to generate a file.
        Usability Requirements: user friendly so that everyone can understand.
        Reliability Requirements: Reliable on the android and pc.
